COLOSSAL VMARC should contain the following files:                              =====================================================================                                                                                                                                                                           COLOSSAL EXEC      ***                                                           A REXX procedure for loading and running the adventure game in                  full screen mode.  This could be improved / adapted to suit the                 environment in which the game is to be played and the players.                  (With luck, if you've un-archived these files onto something you                have accessed as your A disk, typing COLOSSAL should put you                    into a game.)

If you intend to set the game up so that folks other than yourself              are going to play it, I suggest that you make a minor change to                 this and recompile it using the command PLIOPT COLOSSAL .                                                                                                       The program has hard-wired into it the filename, filetype and filemode          of the database file.  You'll see that I've chosen these to be                  ADVENTUR SAVEFILE A . I suggest that you change the filemode from               "A" because that'll be the disk where the players may well want to be           saving their own versions of this file - their saved games.                                                                                                    > COLOSSAL: PROC OPTIONS (MAIN);                                                >                                                                               >      DCL                                                                      >          FN  CHAR(8)  INIT('ADVENTUR') ,   /* FILENAME  ...    */             >                                                                               >          FT  CHAR(8)  INIT('SAVEFILE') ,   /* FILETYPE  ... &  */             >          FM  CHAR(8)  INIT('A       ') ,   /* FILEMODE OF ...  */             >                                            /* ENCODED DATABASE */                                           ! change this to whatever suits                                                                                                                                                                                   COLOSSAL TEXT      ***                                                           The results of compiling COLOSSAL PLIOPT.

I suggest that after re-compiling COLOSSAL PLIOPT, having changed               where it's to find  ADVENTUR SAVEFILE from A to something else,                 you modify the EXECs to suit your fancy, and, finally, plant all the            files required by the player on one of your disks to be linked to               and accessed as something other than "A".                                      =======================================================================                                                                                          This *really* is the original adventure. The program has been translated        into PL/I,but should play just the same as the FORTRAN from which it was        was derived.(I doubt whether there's a modern FORTRAN compiler for              VM/CMS can find its way around the twisty little maze of GOTOs of               the original in the way that IBM's old "G" compiler could?)                     It's probably worth playing if for no other reason than to understand           some of the jokey references in its successors.
